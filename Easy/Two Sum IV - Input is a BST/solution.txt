Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to k, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
-105 <= k <= 105
