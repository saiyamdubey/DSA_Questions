Given an array a of n positive integers. The task is to find the maximum of j - i subjected to the constraint of a[i] < a[j] and i < j.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 2
a[] = {1, 10}
Output:
1
Explanation:
a[0] < a[1] so (j-i) is 1-0 = 1.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 9
a[] = {34, 8, 10, 3, 2, 80, 30, 33, 1}
Output:
6
Explanation:
In the given array a[1] < a[7] satisfying the required condition(a[i] < a[j]) thus giving the maximum difference of j - i which is 6(7-1).
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function maxIndexDiff() which finds and returns maximum index difference. Printing the output will be handled by driver code. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 109
